# Committee Consensus and Verifier Selection in Blockchain-Based Federated Learning

**Existing committee-based blockchain federated learning systems achieve communication efficiency through small validator committees, but fundamentally depend on honest majority assumptions that create exploitable vulnerabilities for progressive capture attacks.** This survey analyzes recent mechanisms (2022-2025) across three dominant selection paradigms—random sampling, stake-weighted, and reputation-based—demonstrating that while each approach reduces consensus overhead from O(n²) to O(C²) or O(C), all share a critical limitation: once malicious actors accumulate sufficient stake or reputation through legitimate means, these systems lack mechanisms to detect or reverse committee compromise.

## Hash-ring and VRF-based random selection reduces overhead but transfers vulnerability to honest majority

BlockDFL, presented at WWW 2024, exemplifies the efficiency-security tradeoff inherent in committee-based validation. The system employs a **deterministic hash ring-based selection mechanism** where "the hash value of last block h₋₁ is mapped to a hash ring where each participant is assigned a space proportional to its stake." This pseudo-random selection enables three-role differentiation (Update Providers, Aggregators, Verifiers) with remarkably small committee sizes—experimental configurations use |V|=4 verifiers and |A|=4 aggregators across 20-60 total participants. The resulting architecture achieves aggregation and verification in under three seconds for models with **1.66 million parameters**, compared to over 30 seconds for 7,850 parameters in comparable systems like Biscotti.

However, BlockDFL's security rests explicitly on committee composition. The consensus mechanism requires "affirmative votes of more than 2/3 verifiers" for block acceptance, implementing standard PBFT tolerance where f malicious participants can be tolerated only when 3f+1 total participants exist. While the paper claims empirical tolerance of **40% malicious participants**, this enhancement "originates from the accumulation of stake held by honest participants"—an assumption that inverts into vulnerability when malicious actors strategically accumulate stake. The system provides no mechanism for recovery once committee integrity degrades, no analysis of adaptive adversaries who time attacks to favorable committee compositions, and no formal complexity analysis of communication costs.

HoldOut SGD takes a more cryptographically rigorous approach using Algorand-style VRF-based sortition where "planning ahead or controlling selection process is not possible." The randomness guarantee theoretically prevents grinding attacks, achieving O(N_p + N_c) communication complexity. Yet the system still requires f < 0.5 Byzantine workers in centralized variants and f < 1/3 for fully distributed configurations. VRF-based selection provides stronger resistance to progressive capture than deterministic approaches, but cannot eliminate the fundamental honest majority dependency—when Byzantine fractions approach thresholds, multiple rounds may see adversarial majorities by probabilistic chance alone.

## Stake-weighted mechanisms create accumulation pathways for rational attackers

Stake-weighted committee selection, inspired by proof-of-stake consensus, appears in systems like Biscotti and VBFL. Biscotti combines VRF-based peer selection with stake requirements through "Proof-of-Federation" consensus, protecting against colluding peers lacking sufficient stake ownership. VBFL implements dedicated proof-of-stake where "stake is more frequently rewarded to honest devices," with malicious devices receiving reduced rewards that decrease their winning probability over time. The system achieves **87% accuracy with 15% malicious devices**, representing 7.4× improvement over vanilla federated learning.

These economic mechanisms assume rational actors will avoid detectable malicious behavior to preserve stake value. However, this assumption fails against strategic adversaries executing progressive accumulation attacks. As documented in proof-of-stake literature, "over time, small sets of wealthy validators can accumulate disproportionate influence unless protocol mechanisms encourage broader participation or cap validator power." The compounding effect—validators earning rewards increase stake, leading to higher selection probability and more rewards—creates a pathway where patient attackers can achieve committee majority through entirely legitimate participation.

FLCoin addresses some concerns through a sliding window mechanism where committee membership expires as new update blocks attach. Experiments demonstrate **90% communication overhead reduction** versus PBFT with linear complexity M_fast = 3(s-1). The committee security follows hypergeometric distribution, achieving 98.4% probability of secure committee composition with window size s=100 and n=500 nodes. Nevertheless, the system explicitly acknowledges that "PoS faces other vulnerabilities, such as the nothing-at-stake problem, in which validators have nothing to lose by supporting multiple forks," and experiments assume no malicious participants—a significant limitation acknowledged by the authors themselves.

## Reputation-based selection enables sophisticated collusion and inflation attacks

Reputation-based committee selection, pioneered by BFLC, selects committee members based on model quality validation through k-fold cross-validation. The framework uses "blockchain for global model storage and local model update exchange" with committee consensus replacing centralized aggregation. Subsequent systems like CBRFL extend this approach with off-chain committee consensus and gradient quality scoring recorded via smart contracts.

These systems face three specific attack vectors. First, **Sybil attacks** allow adversaries to create multiple identities to "overpower honest clients in the system," diluting the reputation pool and increasing probability of committee inclusion. Second, **collusion-based reputation inflation** enables coordinating malicious nodes to mutually validate each other's updates, artificially inflating their reputation scores. BPRFL (2025) explicitly addresses this through "confidence interval consistency verification to detect collusion attacks... preventing mutual election among colluding nodes," implicitly acknowledging the vulnerability in prior systems. Third, **reputation monopolization** becomes inevitable as high-reputation nodes receive more validation opportunities, further increasing their reputation in a self-reinforcing cycle.

VDFChain combines credit-based selection with polynomial commitment verification for aggregation correctness, explicitly acknowledging that "decentralized federated learning solutions with committees still have a malicious aggregation problem when **more than half of committee members are dishonest**." The system references VRF-based secret committee election to defend against adaptive adversaries but cannot address scenarios where adversaries have already accumulated sufficient credit through prior honest behavior.

## Systems lack self-healing once validators achieve legitimate authority

The most critical finding across all surveyed systems is the absence of recovery mechanisms after committee compromise. BlockDFL states that a malicious leader "can only deny votes and broadcast empty blocks to delay iteration"—but provides no analysis of coordinated Byzantine behavior among multiple compromised verifiers. Once malicious stake accumulates past defense thresholds, the system has no mechanism to distinguish between legitimate authority and captured authority.

This vulnerability connects directly to theoretical BFT limitations. As documented in consensus literature, "if a majority of participants are dishonest, attacks can be made that are **within the rules of the protocol** but cause negative effects." The attacked state becomes the new legitimate state. Recovery typically requires external intervention—"trusted sources for recent block headers"—rather than automatic protocol-level healing. FedBlock's future work acknowledges this gap: "we need an incentive mechanism to encourage good participation from verifiers... the selection criterion might not be optimal," but proposes no solution for post-capture recovery.

The progressive committee capture attack proceeds through identifiable phases: entry via Sybil creation or stake acquisition; reputation building through initially honest updates; threshold achievement reaching sufficient committee selection probability; coordinated capture validating malicious updates and inflating collaborator reputation; and persistence without any mechanism for reversal. Research on blockchain consensus confirms this pattern: "a smart Byzantine robot could attempt to obtain tokens by initially sending good models, and later use these tokens to manipulate the shared model."

## Existing approaches cannot defend against coordinated long-term strategies

The surveyed literature reveals a fundamental research gap: existing committee-based BCFL systems assume adversaries attack immediately rather than strategically accumulating influence over time. Random selection provides unpredictability but not Byzantine tolerance beyond thresholds. Stake-weighted mechanisms create economic pathways for patient accumulation. Reputation systems reward consistent behavior that malicious actors can initially provide. All three paradigms assume some form of honest majority—whether >67% for BFT consensus, >50% for simple majority, or probabilistic guarantees based on stake distribution—yet none provides mechanisms to restore honest majority once violated.

This gap motivates defensive architectures that can detect coordinated reputation manipulation, challenge validators whose authority derives from potentially captured historical periods, and automatically heal committee composition without external trusted intervention. The following section introduces Challenge-Augmented Committee Architecture as a response to these limitations.
