    \begin{EnAbstractDescription}
        Blockchain-based Federated Learning (BCFL) addresses trust and privacy concerns through decentralized consensus. Existing BCFL systems rely on committee-based validation, assuming honest or honest-majority committees. This assumption is vulnerable to verifier collusion, where attackers accumulate stake to dominate committees. We identify a novel threat, Progressive Committee Capture Attack (PCCA), where rational attackers exploit incentive mechanisms to gradually accumulate stake and capture sufficient committee seats for coordinated attacks. Once attackers achieve a committee majority, existing architectures cannot detect or prevent such attacks. To defend against PCCA, we propose Audit-driven Committee BlockDFL (AC-BlockDFL), which decouples security from committee composition: a small committee provides liveness through routine validation, while a challenge mechanism backed by global consensus ensures security. Any malicious aggregation triggers cryptographic verification, slashing penalties, and the immediate removal of malicious validators, regardless of their committee representation. This shifts the security threshold from committee majority to global consensus, neutralizing committee capture attacks. Experimental results show that while state-of-the-art methods allow attackers to gain full control, AC-BlockDFL completely eliminates malicious committee members upon attack. Our decoupled design also enables smaller committee sizes, improving computational efficiency without compromising security.
