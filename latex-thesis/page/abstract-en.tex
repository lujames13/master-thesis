    \begin{EnAbstractDescription}
        Blockchain-based Federated Learning (BCFL) addresses trust and privacy concerns through decentralized consensus. Current BCFL systems rely on committee-based validation assuming honest or honest-majority committees. This assumption is vulnerable to verifier collusion, where attackers accumulate stake to dominate committees. We identify Progressive Committee Capture Attack(PCCA), a novel threat where rational attackers exploit incentive mechanisms to gradually accumulate stake and capture sufficient committee seats for coordinated attacks. Existing committee-based architectures cannot detect or prevent such attacks once attackers achieve committee majority. To defend against PCC, we propose an Audit-driven Committee BlockDFL that decouples security from committee composition: a small committee provides liveness through routine validation, while a challenge mechanism backed by global consensus provides security guarantees. Any malicious aggregation triggers cryptographic verification, slashing penalties, and immediate removal of malicious validators—regardless of their committee representation. This shifts the security threshold from committee majority to global network consensus, neutralizing committee capture attacks. Experimental results demonstrate complete elimination of malicious committee members upon attack attempts, while state-of-the-art approaches allow attackers to achieve full committee control and execute unchecked attacks. Our decoupled design also enables smaller committee sizes, improving computational efficiency without compromising security.
